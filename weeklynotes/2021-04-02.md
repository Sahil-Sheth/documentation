### Overall Achievements
* Established a discord server and made channels (with discussion and voice channels) for each team as well as one for managers, product management, and suggestions to create open issues that can benefit the efficiency of MAE development. 
* A role key was created for all of the teams and all team members reacting to identify what role they had in Project MAE
* Chris was named Repository and release manager
* Mukul was named Instruction Set Architect

### Open Issues
* Ensure that all roles and personnel are updated in the README on GitHub
* Everyone should update their GitHub Avatar
* Begin web section that will include weekly notes on: Achievements, Open Issues, and Decisions
* Chris and Matthew need to establish procedures so that new Solid Edge posts to GitHub are in viewable format without the need for special software (scripted and/or automated)
* Mukul and Jonathan need to ensure that all code for MAE is written in Swift with the exception of BASH scripts. Needs to run on Ubuntu. All tools and libraries should be open source
* All posts in this channel need to be logged in weekly notes
* Chris needs to ensure that the repository is setup to where the licensing model is clear
* the MAE 
* 

### Decisions
* We will use the GNU AGPL for all software, and the CC license for everything else.

### Team-Specific Notes
* Meeting times: Wednesdays and Fridays from 16: to 16:30
* All team managers had a meeting on Friday and brought up questions to Connor Redman who was able to clarify the progress of MAE's designing process
* In the case any team needs more members, let Vedant know how many members so that applications can be filled to occupy those spots 

#### Hardware
* A repository was made by Chris for all of the hardware design files on gitHub 
#### R&R
* Repository policies created and licensing is outlined under the Documentation repository
* Created a folder for their team which consisted of a mini-folder (r&r meeting 2021/03/31) which contained the documentation (how to contribute properly, legal doc) for the guidelines

#### ISA
* Mukul set a basic to-do list which entails: 1. write an instruction set:sematics, syntax, etc 2. write an assembler 3. decide on an ABI/API for the machine code format 4. Write the actual evaluation engine for the VM 5. Decide how the function calling will be implemented 6. Memory mapping to io, etc
* ISA decided to create an emulator to test their programs -> they need to have access to people working in hardware in order to know the hardware set up for MAE
* decided to utilize a C compiler to turn C code into basic assembly language
* met up on April 3rd at 7pm
* Mukul condensed two repositories (emulator and accumulator) into one with multiple targets ( eventually the emulator will evolve with the assembly language)

#### Systems Integration
* Akshat also created a list of important things to focus on in SI:
* 1. Having perfect clarity on what's going on in other teams -> can delegate who communicates with which team in the future to organize this process
* 2. Communication with others and facilitating communications between those teams
* 3. Keeping each other up to date and making sure that each team member can commit to as much work as they can complete with clarity.
* Decided to split into software and hardware to focus communication at the moment
* 

#### UX
* Sahil made a list of things to consider for the UX: MAE should be easy to use, it should flow well
* UX will work with UI to know what to design and plan their steps from there
* Approachablity is another area of concern-> Questions to consider:
* 1. Is it intuitive and comfortable for a teenager to use
* 2. How about an eight year old?
* 3. How about an adult, experience programmer?
* 4. How will you handle all of these different scenarios
* Idea: perhaps having three images of cartoon individuals on the welcome screen to offer various options based on the programming level of the individual using MAE
* Figma is a useful tool to plan out the web design
* Raspberry Pi: it will allow for control over the system internals rather than an iPad or android tablet
* Chris is going to setup a linux environment with raspberry pi running in an embedded application

#### UI
* Think about possible layout suggestions
* Should work with UX to communicate said suggestions
* will release a poll in order to decide on color schemes and will use that information in order to start creating logos -> It will most likely lean towards the STEAM logo colors
* Sahil suggested that there be a list of orders for MAE to execute in the case that multiple people online can view the MAE running the specified programs
* There will be a top bar with dropdown menus with the sidebar taking you to certain locations on the website
* Chris came up with an improvement on the queue system with a wait list where the person first in the queue can have access to MAE for an X period of time.
* This system could also include a mode where people can input their own code to add to the same queue of orders for MAE to execute -> This rises the issue of whether or not people could code with the LED's in coordination to make it move (MAE will not be as powerful as the modern computer to show complex code)
* A video feed could show online users MAE's execution of their requested code 

#### QA

#### Mechanical Assembly

#### Webmaster
* Set up basic website explaining Project MAE
* created template for the weekly notes and started web design
* the documentation repository will contain specific informatino about the contributions made by team members 

#### Secretary
